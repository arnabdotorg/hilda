# Introduction
Our goal is to bring together people in the DB research community who are paying attention to the fact that people have distinctive characteristics which impact on the ways data management activities occur. We could include some topics that are similar to those in previous workshops and panels on crowd-sourcing and on interactive data analytics, but our scope covers many more aspects of data management than these, and (to compensate) our focus is narrower in that we target specifically research that considers particular cognitive or physical properties of people as they engage with the data management activities. As well as strengthening the work people are already doing on these issues, by increasing awareness across research groups, we expect a named workshop will raise the visibility of the human aspects in the wider DB community. We also hope to reach out to leaders from other human-centric communities for whom data management tasks might be a novel domain to explore.
