					HILDA brings together researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas and results on human-data interaction. It explores how data management and analysis can be made more effective when taking into account the people who design and build these processes as well as those who are impacted by their results.

				<h2>What to submit</h2>
					<p>
						We encourage both standard research papers and more unusual works—for instance papers that describe in-progress work, reports on experiences, question accepted wisdom, raise open problems, or propose speculative new approaches. A HILDA submission should describe <i>work or perspectives</i> that will lead to interesting discussions at the workshop or that the authors want feedback on.
					</p>

					<p>We welcome work that proposes innovations in design to improve the way people can work with data management systems, as well as work that studies empirically how humans interact with existing systems. We welcome research that comes from the traditions of the database systems community, and also reports on industry activities, and research on data topics from communities that study people and organizations. A sample of topics that are in the spirit of this workshop include, but are not limited to:
					<ul class="topics">
						<li>novel query interfaces,</li>
						<li>interactive query refinement,</li>
						<li>data exploration and analysis,</li>
						<li>data visualization,</li>
						<li>human-assisted data integration and cleaning,</li>
						<li>perception-aware data processing,</li>
						<li>database systems designed for highly interactive use cases,</li>
						<li>empirical studies of database use,</li>
						<li>evaluating and ensuring fairness in data-driven decision making processes</li>
						<li>understanding the outcomes of processes through provenance and explanations</li>
						<li>interactive debugging of complex data systems</li>
						<li>crowd-powered data infrastructure, etc.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<p>Submissions can also examine any of the above topics from an application or domain perspective.</p>

					<p>HILDA is a forum where people from multiple communities engage with one another's ideas. We are keen to have submissions that present initial ideas and visions, just as much as reports on early results, or reflections on completed projects. The workshop will focus on discussion and interaction, rather than static presentations of what is in the paper.

				<h2>Review and Mentorship Process</h2>
				<p>
					We are trying to change things up a bit for HILDA 2022 (inspired by workshops such as <a href="https://2021.plateau-workshop.org">PLATEAU</a>). There are now several good venues for the kind of work that HILDA has traditionally attracted. So our plan is to focus the workshop on <i>early-stage research that is promising and exciting</i>.
				</p>
				<p>
					A core part of this plan is to assign each paper a <strong>mentor</strong>, who has a few roles in addition to reviewing the paper:
					Prior to HILDA, the mentor becomes a shepherd for the submission. They will give detailed and constructive feedback to improve the paper and the project. The mentor also helps the authors with the talk itself. At the workshop itself, the mentor has a reserved brief speaking slot after the authors. The mentor discusses their own view of the work, related areas, and potential directions the authors might pursue.
				</p>

				<p>
					Final camera-ready submissions will be solicited for a selection of the accepted papers after the workshop allowing authors to integrate feedback from discussions with the mentor and workshop participants.

				<h2>Submission</h2>

				<p>Authors are invited to submit papers between four and six pages in length excluding references and using the standard SIGMOD paper formatting template Submissions should reflect the current state of the research work but also include a section on limitations and challenges that they wish to receive feedback from their mentors and the HILDA community on.
				</p>

	<p>All submissions must follow the latest <a href =https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template>ACM paper format</a> with 10pt font size. </p>
	<p>You can submit your papers through <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hilda2022">EasyChair</a>.</p>
